## Repository Notes and Considerations

This repository represents an iteration with enhanced features over its predecessor, though it's important to acknowledge certain limitations. Specifically:

* **"Knowl" Point Feature:** Due to critical security concerns related to potential database API exposure, the "Knowl" point functionality has been intentionally disabled. We prioritize the integrity and security of our data.

* **API Key Management:** While the repository currently includes several free API keys for convenience, these should be considered temporary and for development/testing purposes only. **It is strongly recommended that you replace these keys with your own unique and secure API keys immediately upon cloning this repository.** Failure to do so may result in service disruptions or security vulnerabilities.

We are committed to continuous improvement and are actively working to address these limitations in future updates. Your understanding and adherence to these guidelines are greatly appreciated.
